Subject: [PATCH] mconf: fix output of cflags and libraries

commit 3122c84409d578a5df8bcb1 [kconfig: refactor Makefile to reduce
process forks] changes the way that flags are detected. They are
no longer just echo'd and captured, they are written to a file and
later read.

We adjust our CROSS ncurses patch accordingly.

We'll eventually be able to drop this patch, but not quite yet.
