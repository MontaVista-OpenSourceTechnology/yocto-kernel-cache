Subject: [PATCH] check console device file on fs when booting

If a root filesystem is generated as non-root, one of
the tell tale signs is /dev/console not being a character
file. To save a whole class of questions, let's just test
for the condition and let the user know.

vfs_lstat() which was used previously would fail with certain
configurations. This was likely due to the involved functions being
marked __init at some point in the past.
